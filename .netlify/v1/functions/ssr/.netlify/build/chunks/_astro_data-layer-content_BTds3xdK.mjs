While that’s still better than v1 of the site, v3 wasn't fast enough. Although we are sticking with Astro, we are switching off of Starlight and coding the site from scratch!\r\n\r\n# BCUW v4: What's Changed?\r\n\r\nWe have now switched off of Astro Starlight to just Astro. This will not only help speed up build time but also give us more customizability when it comes to making pages. With this switch, not only do we now have a blog, but we also have a whole new layout! Although we are still working on search, this site should be fully functional by the end of 2024!\r\n\r\n# What's Coming in the Future?\r\n\r\nAh, the fun section! I have a lot of plans for the site, some of which are in alpha and some still in planning. So, they may not be released for a while, if ever, but here’s a list of my plans:\r\n\r\n- A downloadable desktop app (planned)\r\n- A community website designed for buying and selling items and listing your player warps ([alpha](https://community.bcuw.xyz) (USA only as of now, we are trying to get the site up in other countries.))\r\n- A Minecraft mod that connects with the site (both the main docs and the community website) (~planned~ We have permission; programming will start as early as today (as of writing)!)\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, these are mostly ideas, so they may not be implemented.\r\n\r\n# Short Term: What's Happening?\r\n\r\nWithin the next few months, I will be working to get the community website up and running and getting previous crates documented! I plan to have these done by the end of 2024! We should also have a working alpha, if not beta or release, of both the desktop app and Minecraft mod by the end of the year! For now, I will prioritize getting the wiki caught up with all of the crates!\r\n\r\nThat's all for now!

\"react-code-blocks\";\r\n\r\nOne of the best things about having the CELESTIAL [paid rank](/ranks#paid) is that you can get a colored rank. However, making one and submitting it can be a bit annoying the first time. So here is a guide to creating your own RGB ranks.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://utfs.io/a/co6j4hk884/MUfCHtba5zu7wZf72USz517T8hFW0kdE9nAtPLKSjpyGB4fV\" className=\"w-1/2 h-fit float-right rounded-lg m-2\" />\r\n<img src=\"https://utfs.io/a/co6j4hk884/MUfCHtba5zu7rCnCfyY2mGAHpBQ0lJYuESzOdLWTDyia51ge\" className=\"w-1/2 h-fit float-right rounded-lg m-2\" />\r\nCustom RGB ranks are made using fairly simple tools, but if you want symbols or other special characters, submitting the rank on Discord can be a bit tricky and often breaks.\r\n\r\n## Tools\r\nOfficially, BlossomCraft suggests using [this tool](https://codepen.io/0biwan/pen/ggVemP) to make ranks. It works, but isn't the best tool I've found as it only supports the basic colors that Minecraft has built-in. It works, and if you want something basic, it's great. If you want a gradient, I would recommend using [RGBirdflop](https://www.birdflop.com/resources/rgb/). This tool allows you to make a gradient that works well as a rank. It offers many more options, only a few of which you'll need to use to create a rank.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to symbols, I have found that [this website](https://etcgamer.com/minecraft-symbols-emojis/), which AwaitingValhalla posted in the official BlossomCraft Discord, is one of, if not the best, websites to find Minecraft-compatible symbols.\r\n\r\n## Making a rank\r\n\r\nFor this tutorial, I will be remaking my rank (🐉🐉Dovakiin🐉🐉) as an example.\r\n\r\n### Step 1: Choose colors and symbols\r\n\r\nThis is fairly self-explanatory. Choose your colors (in my case, #aaaaaa and #555555—these will be the colors you use for the gradient. Realistically, you can choose as many or as few colors as you want) and your symbols (in my case, I'm only using 🐉).\r\n\r\n### Step 2: Enter it into [RGBirdflop](https://www.birdflop.com/resources/rgb/)\r\n\r\nThis is a very simple step. Just enter your rank name (in my case, 🐉🐉Dovakiin🐉🐉) into the \"Input Text\" text box, then select your colors. You can do this by clicking one of the existing colors, then pasting or choosing your colors. If you need more than two colors, you can add more by clicking the \"+\" button or adjusting the color amount number.\r\n\r\nIt should look something like this when you are done:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://utfs.io/f/MUfCHtba5zu7e9qvdB9zXwvQsBGrRSkMJAq9nL0uKtI4Ypg5\" className=\"w-1/2 h-fit rounded-lg float-left m-2\" />\r\n\r\nNow you can use the formatting options (e.g., bold, italics, underline, etc.). HOWEVER, using underline and obfuscation is not allowed.\r\n\r\nYour rank must be between 1 and 15 characters long.\r\n\r\nAfter this step, it should give you something like this:\r\n\r\n&#aaaaaa🐉&#9c9c9c🐉&#8e8e8eD&#808080o&#717171v&#636363a&#555555h&#636363k&#717171i&#808080i&#8d8d8dn&#9b9b9b🐉&#aaaaaa🐉\r\n\r\n### Step 3: Submit your rank\r\n\r\nThis may seem like an easy step, but it's easy to mess up. And I have.\r\n\r\nFirst, open Discord, head to the official [BlossomCraft Discord server](https://discord.gg/blossomcraft), and go to the [#support](https://discord.com/channels/766373302721445888/922361528563412993) channel to create a ticket under the \"Prefix Changes\" category.\r\n\r\nIt will ask you for three things:\r\n- Username as it appears in-game.\r\n- Rank code.\r\n- Server to deduct money from.\r\n\r\n<Aside type='note' title='Note' bottomRounded={false}>\r\nYour first rank will be free, the rest will cost 15k.\r\n</Aside>\r\n\r\nWhen you fill out the form, do so as instructed. If you have symbols, I recommend sending a second message in the ticket channel with your rank in a code box as shown below:\r\n\r\n<div className=\"flex\">\r\n<Code\r\n  text={\"`&#aaaaaa🐉&#9c9c9c🐉&#8e8e8eD&#808080o&#717171v&#636363a&#555555h&#636363k&#717171i&#808080i&#8d8d8dn&#9b9b9b🐉&#aaaaaa🐉`\"}\r\n  theme={solarizedDark}\r\n  language='md'\r\n/>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nTo do this, copy this character and paste it around the rank, BEFORE sending the message. This is not required, but it ensures the rank is formatted correctly when an admin adds it.\r\n\r\n<Code\r\n  text={\"`\"}\r\n  theme={solarizedDark}\r\n  language='md'\r\n/>\r\n\r\nAfter that, just wait a little while for an admin to add it, and you're done!\r\n\r\n## Thank you to these people for the rank examples at the beginning of the tutorial:\r\n\r\n\r\n-
