# BCUW Status Update

As of now, 7/26/2025, the BCUW project is on hold, this mostly effects the item and crate documentation. The V5 Website is still in active development and will continue to be developed.

# Why is the project on hold?

A mod that is used to get the images of the item lore is currently outdated, until a new version is released ***OR*** we can find a new solution the project cannot get new images.

# What is V5?

We have not yet announced V5, however it is in active development, and should be ready for release by the end of the summer.

V5 is a complete rewrite of the BCUW website aimed to make it easier to maintain and update, it prioritizes speed, ease of use, and accessibility. This website will be the first to allow users to create accounts[^1], make trade listings, and advertise their Player Warps. This website will be replacing the "community website" that was mentioned in the "[Welcome to BCUW v4](https://bcuw.xyz/blog/welcome-to-v4)" blog post.

[^1]: Accounts are only available in the USA for now, we are working on getting accounts available in other countries.

V5's early alpha is already available, and can be found [here](https://v5.bcuw.xyz)[^2].
